# ProteinNetPy

A python library for working with ProteinNet data.
For details of the dataset see the ProteinNet [Bioinformatics paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2932-0) and [repo](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/proteinnet).

Currently WIP so the API will likely change
